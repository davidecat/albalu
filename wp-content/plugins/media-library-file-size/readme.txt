Images and videos play a crucial role in engaging visitors and making a website visually appealing. However, managing these files can become a daunting task, especially when you have a large number of media files on your website. WordPress does offer a media library that allows users to upload and manage media files, but it falls short when it comes to providing information about file sizes. This is where the “Media File Sizes” plugin comes in.

* By default sizes may show without the need to run an index however, indexing the Media Library is highly recommended.
* If sizes do not show, you can click the Index Media button within the Media Library to index/re-index items.
* Shows file size of primary file, plus combined sized for variants (images).
* Ability to order the media items by file size.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The file size does not show for an attachment in the media library? =

First try to index the Media Library by pressing the button 'Index Media' (when viewing the Media Library in list view mode). If this fails, it usually means that the file does not exist locally on the server.

The most common reason is because the file has been offloaded onto a CDN. 

= I do not see a Index Media button? =

Make sure you are looking at your Media Library, and you are in List view. Grid mode does not work with this plugin.

= What is the additional file size e.g. ‘(+27 KB)’ in the file size column? =

This is a collective size of your thumbnails (and other sized images).
