This plugin was designed to achieve 2 major purposes:

1. Assign codes for all your existing products automatically.
So, you don't have to open each WooCommerce product and add the UPC/EAN code manually.

2. Assign codes for newly created products.
So, when you create a new product - the code will be added to the product automatically.

In plugin settings you will need to specify barcode type (EAN or UPC) and the product field where to store the code.

UPC is used in USA and contains 12 digits.
EAN is used wordlwide and contains 13 digits.

You can generate codes into product SKU field or into any other product field as plugin integrated with serveral barcode plugins.
Also you can specify custom field name to use any other product field for UPC/EAN generation.

After you selected required code type, save the settings and then press "Assign codes" button. 
In opened popup you will see progress how much products were processed. 
As soon as codes are generated you can close the window and check your products for generated UPC/EAN codes.

For the new products UPC/EAN barcode will be generated automatically as soon as you save/publish the product.

Generated codes are valid (have correct the last checkum digit) and ready for using in barcode generation tools.

However, from legal point of view free UPC/EAN codes should be used only internaly (inside your website/company).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

You can find this field empty if you didn't start "code generation" process yet.
